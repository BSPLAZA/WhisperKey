# Contributing to WhisperKey

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WhisperKey! This guide will help you get started.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive. We're all here to make dictation better for Mac users.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
1. Check existing issues first
2. Use our issue templates (Bug Report or Feature Request)
3. Include macOS version, WhisperKey version
4. Provide clear reproduction steps
5. Attach logs if relevant (no sensitive data!)

### Branch Structure
We follow a structured branching strategy:
- `main` - Stable releases only (protected)
- `develop` - Integration branch for new features
- `release/v*` - Release preparation and hotfixes
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Submitting Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly (see Testing Guide)
5. Update documentation
6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. Submit PR to `develop` branch (not `main`)
8. Fill out the PR template completely
9. Wait for CI checks to pass
