# WhisperKey v1.0.0 - Initial Release

üéâ **Welcome to WhisperKey** - The privacy-focused local dictation app for macOS that puts you in control of your voice and your data.

## üåü What is WhisperKey?

WhisperKey brings the power of OpenAI's Whisper AI to your Mac's menu bar, enabling fast, accurate voice-to-text transcription that runs entirely on your device. No internet connection required. No data leaves your Mac. Ever.

Simply tap the Right Option key, speak naturally, and watch your words appear at the cursor - in any app, any text field, anywhere on macOS.

## ‚ú® Key Features

## üéØ Why WhisperKey?

Your Mac is powerful enough to handle transcription locally. WhisperKey brings these principles together in a simple, reliable tool that respects your privacy while delivering exceptional accuracy.

**Note on Security Warning**: This release is not code-signed. macOS will display a security warning on first launch. This is normal for open-source releases. To open the app, right-click on WhisperKey and select "Open" from the context menu. You'll only need to do this once.

**Coming Soon**: Developer account and code signing are planned for future releases to eliminate this friction.
