          direct_prompt: |
            Please review this WhisperKey pull request focusing on:
            - Swift code quality and best practices
            - macOS-specific considerations (permissions, sandboxing, etc.)
            - Potential bugs or crashes
            - Performance implications for audio processing
            - Security and privacy concerns
            - Memory management and retain cycles
            
            Consider:
            - This is a menu bar app using SwiftUI
            - It processes audio locally with no network connections
            - Target is macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) and later
            - Must work on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
            
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
