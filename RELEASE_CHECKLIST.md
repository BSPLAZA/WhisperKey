# Setting Up whisper.cpp for WhisperKey

WhisperKey requires whisper.cpp to be installed on your system. This guide will help you set it up.

## Prerequisites
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Git
- About 5GB free disk space

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone whisper.cpp**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Developer
   git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git
   cd whisper.cpp
   ```

2. **Build with Metal Support** (for Apple Silicon)
   ```bash
   WHISPER_METAL=1 make -j
   ```
   
   For Intel Macs:
   ```bash
   make -j
   ```

3. **Download Models**
   ```bash
   cd models
   # Download the models you want:
   bash ./download-ggml-model.sh base.en
   bash ./download-ggml-model.sh small.en
   bash ./download-ggml-model.sh medium.en
   bash ./download-ggml-model.sh large-v3
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ./main -m models/ggml-base.en.bin samples/jfk.wav
   ```
   
   You should see transcribed text output.

## Troubleshooting

### Models Not Found
WhisperKey expects models in: `~/Developer/whisper.cpp/models/`
If you installed elsewhere, you'll need to move the models or wait for the custom path feature.

### Build Errors
- Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed: `xcode-select --install`
- For Metal errors, your Mac might not support Metal acceleration
- Try building without Metal: `make clean && make -j`

### Performance Issues
- Start with smaller models (base.en or small.en)
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Check Activity Monitor for memory pressure
```

### 5. GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Add repository description: "Privacy-focused local dictation for macOS powered by OpenAI's Whisper"
- [ ] Add topics: `macos`, `swift`, `whisper`, `speech-to-text`, `dictation`, `privacy`, `menu-bar-app`
- [ ] Set up About section:
  - [ ] Website: (if you have one)
  - [ ] Check "Releases"
  - [ ] Check "Issues"
- [ ] Create initial labels for issues:
  - `bug`
  - `enhancement` 
  - `documentation`
  - `help wanted`
  - `good first issue`

### 6. Create Issue Templates

   swift package clean
   swift build -c release
   
   # Run all tests
   swift test
   ```

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these after release:
- GitHub stars
