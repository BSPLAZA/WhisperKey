# WhisperKey v1.0.2 Release Notes

**Release Date**: July 17, 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix Release

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Keyboard Focus After Dictation
- **Fixed**: Enter key and other keyboard shortcuts now work immediately after dictation in most applications
- **Technical**: Implemented proper event stream termination using space+backspace technique
- **Impact**: Significant UX improvement - no more clicking or typing required before pressing Enter

### Recording Indicator Visibility
- **Fixed**: Recording indicator now appears properly in web browsers and all window contexts
- **Technical**: Changed window level from `statusBar` to `floatingWindow + 1`
- **Impact**: Users always have visual feedback that recording is active

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Brave Browser URL Bar
- **Issue**: After dictation in Brave's URL bar, users must press Space then Enter
- **Reason**: This is an intentional security feature in Brave, not a bug in WhisperKey
- **Workaround**: Simply press Space after dictation, then Enter to navigate
- **Note**: Regular text fields in Brave work perfectly - only the URL bar is affected
