# WhisperKey Simple Development Plan

## The Goal
Build a macOS menu bar app that transcribes speech to text when you press Right Option.

## The Solution
1. **Menu bar app** - Shows üé§ icon, indicates recording status
2. **Right Option hotkey** - Reliable, no conflicts with system
3. **Local Whisper** - Privacy-focused transcription
4. **Type anywhere** - Works in any text field

### Phase 2: Audio Pipeline ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Audio recording with AVAudioEngine
- [x] Silence detection (2.5 second threshold)

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Swift 5.9
- **UI**: SwiftUI + AppKit (menu bar)
- **Hotkeys**: HotKey library by soffes
- **Audio**: AVAudioEngine
- **Transcription**: whisper.cpp
- **Text Input**: AXUIElement + CGEvent

## Key Files
- `MenuBarApp.swift` - Main app entry
- `DictationService.swift` - Recording & transcription
- `HotkeyManager.swift` - Right Option handling
- `TextInsertion.swift` - Cursor interaction

## No Longer Worried About
- ‚ùå F5 key interception (impossible)
- ‚ùå Complex permission flows
- ‚ùå Kernel extensions
- ‚ùå Fighting macOS

## Current Status
App is feature-complete at version 1.0.0-rc2. All core functionality working perfectly.

## Next Steps
1. Test across 8 different applications
2. Handle readonly fields gracefully
3. Prepare for release
