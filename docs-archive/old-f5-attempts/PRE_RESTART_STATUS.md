# WhisperKey Pre-Restart Status Capture
**Date:** 2025-07-01 11:30 AM

## Current Issue Status

### ✅ FIXED Issues
1. **Accessibility Permission Loop**
   - Was prompting even when granted
   - Fixed by: Killing stuck process, resetting permissions, updating permission check code
   - Now working correctly

### ❌ UNRESOLVED Issues
1. **F5 Key Interception**
   - F5 still triggers Apple system dictation
   - Karabiner cannot remap F5 to F13
   - Virtual HID driver error: "virtual_hid_keyboard is not ready"

## Technical State

### Karabiner Status
```
System Extension: activated waiting for user (but no dialog appears)
Config: F5 → F13 mapping configured in both simple and complex modifications
Event Viewer: Shows F5 as "f5" not "f13" (remapping not working)
Log: Persistent "virtual_hid_keyboard is not ready" warnings
```

### Permissions Granted
- ✅ WhisperKey: Accessibility
- ✅ karabiner_grabber: Input Monitoring  
- ✅ karabiner_observer: Input Monitoring
- ✅ Karabiner-Elements: Input Monitoring
- ✅ Karabiner-EventViewer: Input Monitoring

### System Changes Made
1. Disabled system dictation: 
   ```bash
   defaults write com.apple.HIToolbox AppleDictationAutoEnable -int 0
   defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 162 '<dict><key>enabled</key><false/></dict>'
   ```

2. Installed Karabiner configuration at:
   - `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`
   - `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/whisperkey.json`

### WhisperKey Code Status
- Using `EnhancedKeyCaptureService` with multiple detection methods
- Supports F5, F13, and ⌘⇧D shortcuts
- CGEventTap and IOKit HID monitoring active
- Alternative shortcut ⌘⇧D works correctly

## What We're Testing After Restart

1. **Primary Goal**: Get Karabiner virtual HID driver working
   - Should see approval dialog after restart
   - F5 should remap to F13 in Event Viewer

2. **Fallback Test**: With system dictation disabled
   - F5 might not trigger anything
   - WhisperKey might be able to capture it directly

3. **Success Criteria**:
   - Karabiner Event Viewer shows F5 as "f13"
   - WhisperKey detects F5 presses
   - No system dictation dialog appears

## Restart Instructions
1. Run `./scripts/prepare-restart.sh`
2. After restart, open Karabiner-Elements FIRST
3. Look for any system extension approval dialogs
4. Test in Karabiner-EventViewer
5. Report back with results

## If Restart Doesn't Fix It
We'll research:
- BetterTouchTool as alternative
- Hammerspoon for low-level key interception
- Creating our own DriverKit extension
- Using Karabiner's URL scheme as workaround
- Checking if this is an Apple Silicon vs Intel issue

## Time Investment
- 5 hours total on F5 interception issue
- Multiple approaches tried
- Core issue: macOS security model vs third-party keyboard modification
