# WhisperKey F5 Working Solution

## Current Situation
- Karabiner-Elements cannot intercept F5 due to virtual HID driver issues
- System extension is "waiting for user" approval but not showing in System Settings
- This is a known issue on newer macOS versions

## Working Solutions

### Option 1: Use Alternative Shortcut (Immediate)
WhisperKey already supports **⌘⇧D** (Command+Shift+D):
1. Open WhisperKey
2. Click "Start Listening"
3. Press ⌘⇧D instead of F5
4. This works immediately without Karabiner

### Option 2: Disable System Dictation (Quick Fix)
```bash
# Run this to disable system dictation completely
defaults write com.apple.HIToolbox AppleDictationAutoEnable -int 0
defaults delete com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys 2>/dev/null

# Then in System Settings:
# Keyboard → Dictation → Turn OFF
# Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Dictation → Uncheck "Turn dictation on or off"
```

### Option 3: Fix Karabiner (Requires Restart)
1. **Restart your Mac**
2. **Before logging in**, restart in Safe Mode:
   - Intel: Hold Shift while starting up
   - Apple Silicon: Hold power button, then hold Shift
3. **In Safe Mode**, open System Settings → Privacy & Security
4. Look for any pending approvals
5. **Restart normally**
6. Open Karabiner-Elements first before other apps
7. Check if virtual HID is now ready

### Option 4: Alternative Karabiner Config
Since simple modifications aren't working, try this:
1. Open Karabiner-Elements
2. Go to "Complex Modifications" → "Add rule"
3. Import from internet
4. Search for "Change caps_lock to escape"
5. Enable any rule (this forces driver load)
6. Then your F5 rule might work

### Option 5: Use Karabiner's URL Scheme
Your config already has this option. Enable the rule:
"Alternative: Remap F5 to launch WhisperKey URL scheme"

This opens WhisperKey directly instead of remapping keys.

## Recommended Approach

**For immediate use:**
1. Use ⌘⇧D shortcut - it works right now
2. Or disable system dictation completely

**For F5 support:**
1. Restart your Mac
2. Check for system extension approval after restart
3. If still not working, use the URL scheme approach

## Technical Details
The issue is that Karabiner's virtual HID device driver needs system-level approval that isn't appearing in the UI. This is a macOS bug where the approval prompt doesn't show even though the system knows it needs approval (status: "activated waiting for user").

## Alternative Tools
If Karabiner continues to fail:
- BetterTouchTool (paid, but reliable)
- Hammerspoon (free, Lua scripting)
- Keyboard Maestro (paid, very powerful)
