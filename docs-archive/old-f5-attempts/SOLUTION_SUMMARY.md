# WhisperKey Solution Summary

## The Problem
You wanted F5 to trigger your custom dictation service instead of Apple's. We discovered:

1. **F5 is system-reserved**: macOS intercepts F5 at kernel level for dictation
2. **CGEventTap can't block it**: User-space APIs can't override system keys
3. **Even Karabiner struggles**: Kernel-level tools have issues with newer Macs
4. **TCC database issues**: Accessibility permissions show false positives

## The Root Cause
Apple has locked down F5 for system dictation at a level below where third-party apps can intercept it. This is by design for security and consistency.

## The Solution: Don't Fight the System

### New Architecture
1. **Menu Bar App**: Lightweight, always accessible, shows recording status
2. **HotKey Library**: Battle-tested Carbon-based library that actually works
3. **F13 Default**: No conflicts, same convenience as F5
4. **User Choice**: Configurable hotkeys for personal preference

### Why This Works
- F13-F19 aren't reserved by macOS
- Carbon Events API (though deprecated) still functions perfectly
- Menu bar apps are the standard for this type of utility
- No accessibility permission headaches

### Implementation
```swift
// Simple, reliable global hotkey
let hotKey = HotKey(key: .f13, modifiers: [])
hotKey.keyDownHandler = { 
    startWhisperDictation() 
}
```

## For Users Who Insist on F5

If you absolutely must use F5:

1. **Disable System Dictation Completely**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/comprehensive-fix.sh
   ```

2. **Use Standard Function Keys**:
   - System Settings → Keyboard → Function Keys
   - Enable "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys"

3. **Install Karabiner-Elements**:
   - Create complex modification to intercept F5
   - Still may not work on all Macs

## The Better Path Forward

1. **Embrace F13**: It's literally designed for custom functions
2. **Or use Cmd+Shift+Space**: Memorable and reliable
3. **Focus on the experience**: Fast, accurate dictation matters more than which key

## Next Steps

1. Update Xcode project to use MenuBarApp.swift
2. Test with F13 (or your chosen hotkey)
3. Integrate whisper.cpp for actual transcription
4. Ship a working product instead of fighting the OS

## Key Lesson

Sometimes the best solution is to work with the system rather than against it. F13 provides the same one-key convenience as F5 without any of the headaches.
