# Right Option Key Setup

## Why Right Option?

The Right Option (âŒ¥) key is perfect for WhisperKey because:
- You have two Option keys but rarely need both
- Easy to reach with your right thumb
- No conflicts with system shortcuts
- More intentional than accidental F5 presses

## Location on Your Keyboard

```
[cmd] [option] [<- space ->] [option] [cmd]
                                â†‘
                          Right Option (âŒ¥)
                          Press this for dictation
```

## How It Works

1. **Press and release** Right Option to start recording
2. **Speak naturally** - WhisperKey captures your audio
3. **Press Right Option again** to stop, or wait 2 seconds of silence
4. **Text appears** at your cursor

## First Time Setup

When you first launch WhisperKey:

1. **Grant Accessibility Permission**
   - You'll see a system prompt
   - Go to System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Accessibility
   - Enable WhisperKey

2. **Test It**
   - Open any text app (Notes, TextEdit, etc.)
   - Click in a text field
   - Press Right Option
   - Say "Hello world"
   - Press Right Option again

## Changing the Hotkey

If Right Option doesn't work for you:

1. Click ðŸŽ¤ in menu bar
2. Select "Hotkey: Right âŒ¥"
3. Choose an alternative:
   - **Caps Lock** - Great if you never use caps
   - **âŒ˜â‡§Space** - Similar to Spotlight
   - **F13/F14** - If you have an extended keyboard

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I press Right Option"

1. Check WhisperKey is running (ðŸŽ¤ in menu bar)
2. Verify accessibility permission is granted
3. Make sure your cursor is in a text field
4. Try restarting WhisperKey

### "I use Right Option for special characters"

Consider switching to:
- Caps Lock (most popular alternative)
- F13 (if available)
- Custom combination like âŒ˜â‡§D

### "Can I use Left Option instead?"

Not recommended - Left Option is used in many app shortcuts (Option+Delete, Option+Arrow, etc.)

## Pro Tips

- The key works globally - in any app, any text field
- You can change the silence threshold in settings
- Hold Escape while recording to cancel
- The menu bar icon shows recording status (ðŸŽ¤ red = recording)
