# WhisperKey Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Update Xcode Project (You need to do this)

1. **Open WhisperKey.xcodeproj** in Xcode
2. **Add HotKey Package**:
   - File â†’ Add Package Dependencies
   - URL: `https://github.com/soffes/HotKey`
   - Add to WhisperKey target
3. **Set MenuBarApp.swift as main**:
   - Delete/rename WhisperKeyApp.swift
   - Ensure MenuBarApp.swift has `@main`
4. **Update Info.plist**:
   - Add: `Application is agent (UIElement)` = YES
   - This hides from Dock
5. **Build and Run** (Cmd+R)

### 2. Test Right Option Key

Once running:
1. Look for ðŸŽ¤ in menu bar
2. Open any text app (Notes, TextEdit)
3. Click in text field
4. Press Right Option (âŒ¥) 
5. Icon should turn red (recording)
6. Say something
7. Press Right Option again to stop

### 3. If Right Option Doesn't Work

Run: `./scripts/test-right-option.swift` to verify key detection

Common issues:
- Need accessibility permission
- Key might be mapped to something else
- Try Caps Lock instead (change in menu)

## What We've Accomplished

### Solved âœ…
- F5 interception impossible â†’ Use Right Option
- Complex permissions â†’ Simple accessibility only
- TCC database bugs â†’ Clean hotkey approach
- Overcomplicated architecture â†’ Simple menu bar app

### Documentation Cleaned âœ…
- Archived all F5-related docs
- Created simple, focused plan
- Clear user and developer READMEs
- Streamlined to essentials

### Code Ready âœ…
- MenuBarApp.swift with Right Option support
- Clean architecture
- Configurable hotkeys
- Ready for audio integration

## What's Next (Phase 2)

After confirming Right Option works:

1. **Audio Recording**
   - AVAudioEngine setup
   - 16kHz sampling
   - Ring buffer
   - Silence detection

2. **Whisper Integration**
   - Link whisper.cpp
   - Load base.en model
   - Async transcription

3. **Text Insertion**
   - AXUIElement for cursor position
   - Insert at cursor
   - Handle edge cases

## The Bottom Line

We've pivoted from fighting macOS to working with it. Right Option is:
- More reliable than F5
- No system conflicts  
- Better user experience
- Actually implementable

Ready to build and test!
