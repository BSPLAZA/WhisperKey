# Changes Summary - 2025-07-10 09:30

## Issues Fixed Based on User Feedback

### 1. Simplified Permissions Handling ✅
**Problem**: Over-complicated permission handling triggered dialog 4 times
**Solution**: Removed AccessibilityHelper class and simplified to basic system call
**Result**: Clean, simple permission flow - dialog shows once as expected

### 2. Increased Dialog Size ✅
**Problem**: First page required scrolling, header was obscured
**Old Size**: 600x600
**New Size**: 700x700
**Result**: All content fits without scrolling

### 3. Fixed Model Sizes ✅
**Problem**: All models showed same size (confusing)
**Fixed Sizes**:
- base.en: 39 MB (was showing 141 MB)
- base: 74 MB
- small.en: 141 MB (was showing 465 MB)
- small: 244 MB
- medium.en: 465 MB (was showing 1.4 GB)
- medium: 769 MB
- large-v3: 1.55 GB (was showing 2.9 GB)
**Result**: Users can see actual size differences

### 4. Improved Model Selection UI ✅
**Problem**: 7 models didn't fit, next button not visible
**Solution**: Added ScrollView with max height of 350px
**Result**: All models visible with scrolling, next button accessible

### 5. Removed Scrolling from Welcome Step ✅
**Problem**: Welcome step had unnecessary ScrollView
**Solution**: Changed to regular VStack with proper spacing
**Result**: Clean layout without scrolling

### 6. Slowed Permission Check Timer ✅
**Problem**: Checking every 0.5 seconds was too aggressive
**Solution**: Changed to check every 2 seconds
**Result**: Less resource usage, still responsive
