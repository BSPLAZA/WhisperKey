# Commit Strategy - 2025-07-10

## Current Situation

We have accumulated many changes without committing:
- Fixed Right Option key (was a user config issue)
- Added recording timer
- Added audio feedback sounds
- Enhanced UI with animations
- Simplified hotkey options
- Fixed various UI bugs

## The Problem

- Mixed functional fixes with UI enhancements
- Timer not resetting between recordings
- Recording dialog text truncated
- Onboarding dialog formatting broken
- Too many changes in one batch

## Smart Commit Strategy

### Option 1: Commit Working Features First (RECOMMENDED)
1. Stash UI changes temporarily
2. Commit core fixes that work:
   - Right Option key fix
   - Basic audio feedback
   - Simplified hotkey options
3. Then fix and commit UI improvements separately

### Option 2: Fix Everything First
1. Fix all current issues
2. Test thoroughly
3. Make one large commit
(Risk: More could break)

### Option 3: Revert and Rebuild
1. Reset to last commit
2. Apply changes incrementally
(Risk: Could lose work)

## Immediate Issues to Fix

### Recording Dialog
- Text truncation with ellipses
- Timer not resetting between sessions
- Remove "ESC to cancel" text

### Onboarding Dialog
- Layout overlapping issues
- Keeps showing repeatedly
- Accessibility permission flow broken

## Proposed Git Workflow

```bash
# 1. First, commit documentation updates (safe)
git add docs/*.md README.md
git commit -m "Docs: Update documentation with current status

DOCS: Comprehensive update
- Updated all timestamps to 2025-07-10
- Added language support research
- Created future planning documents
- Fixed outdated information

STATUS: Documentation current"

# 2. Stash current code changes
git stash push -m "WIP: UI improvements with issues"

# 3. Selectively apply working fixes
git stash pop
# Then carefully stage only working code

# 4. Commit core fixes
git add [specific working files]
git commit -m "Fix: Right Option key and core improvements

TESTED ✅: Right Option key working
- Fixed hotkey detection (was user config issue)
- Simplified hotkey options to Right Option and F13
- Added basic audio feedback infrastructure
- Improved debug logging

STATUS: Core functionality working"

# 5. Fix UI issues in new commit
# Fix the timer reset, text truncation, etc.
git commit -m "Fix: UI issues and recording indicator

TESTED ✅: Recording indicator improvements
- Fixed timer reset between recordings
- Fixed text truncation in recording dialog
- Removed ESC hint from indicator
- Fixed onboarding dialog layout

STATUS: UI polished and functional"
```

## Going Forward

### Commit Guidelines
1. **Commit early and often** - Every working feature
2. **Test before commit** - Never commit broken code
3. **Atomic commits** - One logical change per commit
4. **Clear messages** - Follow our commit format

### Branch Strategy (Future)
```bash
main                    # Stable, working code
├── feature/languages   # Multi-language support
├── fix/ui-issues      # UI bug fixes
└── enhance/ux         # UX improvements
```

## Current Priority

1. Fix timer reset issue
2. Fix text truncation
3. Fix onboarding layout
4. Remove ESC hint from indicator
5. Test everything
6. Commit in logical chunks
