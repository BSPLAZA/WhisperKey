## What's Remaining üìù

### Testing (8 tasks) - HIGH PRIORITY
1. TextEdit - Multiple text formats
2. Safari - Forms and text areas
3. Terminal - Secure input detection
4. VS Code/Xcode - Code editors
5. Slack/Discord - Messaging apps
6. Office apps - Word, Excel, PowerPoint
7. Password managers - Security verification
8. Multiple displays - Multi-monitor setup

### Features (1 task) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **Readonly field handling** - Graceful failure for non-editable fields (partially complete)

### Completed Features (2025-07-09)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced onboarding experience** - Animated welcome flow with feature cards
- ‚úÖ **Recording duration timer** - Real-time feedback during recording
- ‚úÖ **Audio feedback sounds** - Optional sounds for start/stop/success
- ‚úÖ **Visual design improvements** - Better spacing and organization

### Future Enhancements (PRIORITIZED)

#### Phase 1: Language Support (HIGH)
- **Manual language selection** - Add dropdown for 99 Whisper languages
- **Multilingual models** - Support base/small/medium (not just .en versions)
- **Language persistence** - Remember last used language

#### Phase 2: Advanced Language Features (MEDIUM)
- **Auto language detection** - Use Whisper's built-in detection
- **Language indicator** - Show detected/selected language in UI
- **Quick language switcher** - Hotkey for common languages
- **Mixed language warning** - Alert users about code-switching limitations

#### Phase 3: Model Flexibility (MEDIUM)
- **Abstract transcription interface** - Support multiple backends
- **Plugin architecture** - Allow community models
- **Model marketplace** - Easy discovery of new models
- **Rebranding consideration** - "VoiceKey" or "DictateAnywhere"

#### Phase 4: Other Enhancements (LOW)
- Memory pressure detection
- Audio device switching handling
- Recording quality settings
- Model auto-selection based on language
- Per-app language preferences
- Cloud model support (opt-in only)
- **Custom model path preference** - Let users specify where models are stored
- **Model path auto-detection** - Scan common locations for existing models

## Key Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Planned**: 24 days total (8 days to MVP)
- **Actual**: 2 days to MVP, 3 days to release candidate
- **Efficiency**: 4x faster than planned
- **Total hours**: ~27.5 hours (20 MVP + 7.5 polish)
- **Key insight**: Spent 2+ hours debugging non-existent bug (user had wrong setting)

### Code Statistics
- **Swift files**: 10 main components
- **Lines of code**: ~3,000
- **Error types**: 30+
- **Preferences**: 15 user settings

### Quality Indicators
- **Transcription accuracy**: 10/10 (non-streaming)
- **Response time**: <3s end-to-end
- **Memory usage**: ~50MB idle, ~200MB active
- **Crash rate**: 0 (no crashes reported)

## Technical Decisions

### What Worked Well
1. **Menu bar architecture** - Perfect for always-available utility
2. **Right Option key** - Natural hotkey choice
3. **whisper.cpp** - Reliable and fast with Metal
4. **SwiftUI** - Clean, modern UI development
5. **No streaming** - Simplified architecture, better quality

### What We Learned
1. **F5 is untouchable** - System reserves it completely
2. **Whisper needs context** - 2-5 seconds minimum for accuracy
3. **Permissions matter** - Don't duplicate system dialogs
4. **Visual feedback crucial** - Users need to see recording state
5. **Simple is better** - Removed streaming for better UX
6. **Check user settings first** - Wasted 2+ hours on working code
7. **Audio feedback matters** - Makes app feel more responsive
8. **Duration visibility** - Users want to know recording time

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Begin systematic testing in TextEdit
2. Test Safari form compatibility
3. Verify Terminal secure input detection

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Complete all 8 testing tasks
2. Handle readonly fields gracefully
3. Create onboarding experience
4. Prepare for beta release

### Long Term (Future)
1. Explore unique differentiators
2. Add power user features
3. Consider App Store distribution
4. Build user community
5. **Model-agnostic architecture** - Abstract transcription engine to support multiple AI models (Whisper, MMS, USM, etc.)
6. **Generic branding** - Consider names like "VoiceKey" or "LocalScribe" for broader appeal
7. **Plugin system** - Allow community to add new transcription models

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Dependency on whisper.cpp** - Could break with updates
- **Carbon API usage** - Deprecated but still working
- **Accessibility API changes** - macOS updates could break

### Market Risks
- **Saturated market** - 10+ competitors exist
- **Native dictation improving** - Apple enhancing built-in
- **Limited differentiation** - Need unique features

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing across macOS versions
- Clear documentation for troubleshooting
- Focus on reliability over features
- Find niche use cases

## Conclusion

WhisperKey has exceeded initial expectations, achieving a polished MVP in record time. The architecture is solid, the UX is professional, and the core functionality works reliably. The main work remaining is systematic testing across applications and minor polish items.

The app demonstrates that with focused development and smart architectural choices, complex functionality can be delivered quickly without sacrificing quality.
