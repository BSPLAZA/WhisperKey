# WhisperKey Current Status

*Last Updated: 2025-07-12 10:30 AM PST*

## 🎯 Project Status: Beta Ready (with minor polish needed)

### ✅ What's Working

#### Core Functionality
- **Recording**: Right Option key starts/stops recording perfectly
- **Transcription**: Whisper integration working with all models
- **Text Insertion**: Smart detection of text fields vs non-text areas
- **Clipboard Fallback**: Intelligent backup system with user control
- **Audio Feedback**: Glass sound for insertion, Pop sound for clipboard

#### User Experience
- **Onboarding**: 5-step wizard with permissions, models, and settings
- **Settings**: All preferences properly persist
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing models, permissions, etc.
- **Visual Feedback**: Recording indicator with timer and audio levels

#### Technical
- **Window Management**: All dialogs open/close without crashes
- **Memory Management**: No leaks, proper cleanup
- **Permissions**: Clear guidance and recovery paths
- **Model Management**: Download, selection, and switching works

### 🔧 What Needs Improvement

#### 1. Recording Tab Terminology (Priority: HIGH)
**Current Issues**:
- "Silence sensitivity" is confusing
- Users don't understand what the sliders control
- Labels don't match mental model

**Proposed Changes**:
- Rename to "Microphone Sensitivity" or "Recording Threshold"
- Better descriptions explaining the effect
- Visual feedback showing current levels
- Presets for common scenarios

#### 2. Onboarding UI Polish (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current Issues**:
- Functional but not visually stunning
- Some spacing issues
- Could feel more premium

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Better animations between steps
- More visual polish on components
- Consistent spacing throughout
- Premium feel to match functionality

### 📊 Testing Status

**Completed Tests**: ~35/65 scenarios
- ✅ First launch experience
- ✅ Permission flows
- ✅ Model management
- ✅ Basic recording
- ✅ Settings persistence
- ✅ Clipboard behavior
- ⏳ Multi-app testing (partial)
- ⏳ Edge cases (partial)
- ❌ DMG packaging
- ❌ Clean system test

### 🎯 Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Recording Tab** (2-3 hours)
   - Redesign the controls with better terminology
   - Add visual feedback
   - Make it intuitive

2. **Polish Onboarding** (1-2 hours)
   - Visual improvements
   - Smoother transitions
   - Premium feel

3. **Complete Testing** (2-3 hours)
   - Work through remaining test scenarios
   - Document any issues found
   - Verify all paths work

4. **Create Release** (1 hour)
   - Build DMG package
   - Include documentation
   - Test on clean Mac

### 🚀 Release Readiness

**Current State**: 85% ready
- Core functionality: ✅ 100%
- Error handling: ✅ 100%
- UI/UX: 🔄 75% (needs polish)
- Testing: 🔄 50% (in progress)
- Packaging: ❌ 0% (not started)

### 🎨 Design Decisions

1. **Clipboard Philosophy**: Always available as safety net, but user controls persistence
2. **Sound Feedback**: Different sounds communicate different actions clearly
3. **Error Recovery**: Never lose user's work, always provide path forward
4. **Permissions**: Guide users through system requirements without frustration

### 🔮 Post-Beta Considerations

Once beta is released and stable:
- Voice commands ("new paragraph", "period")
- Multiple language support
- Advanced audio processing
- Cloud model support (optional)
- Keyboard shortcuts customization

## Summary

WhisperKey is functionally complete and stable. The remaining work is primarily UI polish and comprehensive testing. The app successfully provides a privacy-focused, local dictation solution that matches or exceeds Apple's built-in dictation in functionality while keeping all data on-device.
