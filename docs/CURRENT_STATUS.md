## 🎯 Project Status: Beta Ready (with minor polish needed)

### ✅ What's Working

#### Core Functionality
- **Recording**: Right Option key starts/stops recording perfectly
- **Transcription**: Whisper integration working with all models
- **Text Insertion**: Smart detection of text fields vs non-text areas
- **Clipboard Fallback**: Intelligent backup system with user control
- **Audio Feedback**: Glass sound for insertion, Pop sound for clipboard

#### User Experience
- **Onboarding**: 5-step wizard with permissions, models, and settings
- **Settings**: All preferences properly persist
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing models, permissions, etc.
- **Visual Feedback**: Recording indicator with timer and audio levels

#### Technical
- **Window Management**: All dialogs open/close without crashes

### 🔧 What Needs Improvement

#### 1. ~~Recording Tab Terminology~~ ✅ FIXED (12:30 PM)
**What Was Fixed**:

- Polish the hotkey test area
- Match the quality of Recording tab

#### 3. Onboarding UI Polish (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Current Issues**:
- Functional but not visually stunning
