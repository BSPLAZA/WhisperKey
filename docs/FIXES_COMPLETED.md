# WhisperKey Fixes Completed

## 1. Fixed Hardcoded Paths ✅

**Date**: 2025-07-10 18:45 PST
**Time Taken**: 45 minutes

### What Was Fixed

#### Created WhisperService.swift
- Centralized management of whisper.cpp paths
- Searches multiple common locations automatically:
  - `~/.whisperkey/bin/whisper-cli`
  - `~/Developer/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli`
  - `/usr/local/bin/whisper-cli`
  - `/opt/homebrew/bin/whisper-cli`
- Allows users to set custom paths via preferences

#### Updated WhisperCppTranscriber.swift
- Removed hardcoded path `/Users/orion/Developer/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli`
- Now uses WhisperService for dynamic path detection
- Added proper error handling when whisper not found
- Made class @MainActor to work with WhisperService

#### Updated ModelManager.swift
- Removed hardcoded `~/Developer/whisper.cpp/models` path
- Now uses WhisperService for models directory
- Falls back to `~/.whisperkey/models` if not found

#### Updated DictationService.swift
- Added check for whisper availability before recording
- Shows helpful error dialog if whisper not found
- Prevents crashes when dependencies missing

#### Added UI in Preferences
- New "Custom Paths" section in Advanced tab
- Users can browse and select custom whisper/models paths
- Shows current status (found/not found)
- Paths persist across app launches

### Testing Needed
- [ ] Test on system without whisper.cpp installed
- [ ] Test with whisper.cpp in non-standard location
- [ ] Test custom path selection
- [ ] Verify error messages are helpful

### Code Changes Summary
```swift
// Before (BROKEN):
let whisperPath = "/Users/orion/Developer/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli"

// After (FIXED):
guard let whisperPath = whisperService.whisperPath else {
    throw WhisperKeyError.dependencyMissing(
        "WhisperKey couldn't find whisper.cpp. Please install it or set a custom path in Settings."
    )
}
```

### User Experience Improvements
1. App no longer crashes if whisper.cpp missing
2. Clear error message with actionable steps
3. Can set custom paths without editing code
4. Searches common installation locations automatically

## 2. Removed All Force Unwraps ✅

**Date**: 2025-07-10 19:00 PST
**Time Taken**: 15 minutes

### What Was Fixed

#### TextInsertionService.swift
- Fixed unsafe force cast in `getFocusedElement()`
- Old: `return result == .success ? (focusedElement as! AXUIElement) : nil`
- New: Type-safe check using `CFGetTypeID()` before casting
- Prevents crash if unexpected type returned

#### WhisperCppTranscriber.swift
- Fixed force unwrap of `process.arguments!`
- Old: `DebugLogger.log("Running whisper with arguments: \(process.arguments!)")`
- New: `DebugLogger.log("Running whisper with arguments: \(process.arguments ?? [])")`
- Prevents crash if arguments not set

### Safety Improvements
- No more force unwraps (`!`) in the codebase
- All type casts are now verified before execution
- Graceful handling of nil values
- Better crash protection

### Code Quality
- Searched entire codebase for:
  - `try!` - none found
  - `as!` - fixed all instances
  - Force unwrapped properties - fixed all instances
- App is now much more resilient to unexpected conditions
