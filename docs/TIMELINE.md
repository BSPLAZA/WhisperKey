## Phase 1: Core Prototype

**Planned Duration**: 4 days (Days 2-5)  
**Started**: 2025-07-01 08:00 PST  
**Completed**: 2025-07-01 21:00 PST  
**Actual Hours**: 13 hours  

### Tasks
- [x] Create Xcode project "WhisperKey" with SwiftUI
- [x] Configure entitlements and Info.plist
- [x] Implement basic HID event monitoring
- [x] Test dictation key interception (FAILED - F5 impossible)
- [x] Basic CoreAudio recording setup (AVAudioEngine)
- [x] Simple whisper.cpp integration (file-based)
- [x] Proof-of-concept text insertion
- [x] Verify permissions flow

### Blockers
- F5 key interception impossible at user level (system-reserved)
- Pivoted to menu bar app with Right Option key

### Key Decisions
- Abandoned F5 key approach for menu bar + hotkey
- Selected HotKey library for global hotkeys
- Implemented Right Option key via NSEvent monitoring
- Tested streaming extensively (removed due to quality issues)

## Phase 2: Audio Pipeline & Streaming

**Planned Duration**: 3 days (Days 6-8)  
**Started**: 2025-07-01 17:00 PST  
**Completed**: 2025-07-01 21:30 PST  
**Actual Hours**: 4.5 hours  

### Tasks
- [x] Implement audio buffer for streaming
- [x] Add real-time audio level monitoring
- [x] Create silence detection algorithm (2-second threshold)
- [x] Test various silence thresholds (0.001 â†’ 0.005)
- [x] Implement streaming transcription mode
- [x] Add audio format conversion (48kHz â†’ 16kHz)
- [x] Build whisper-stream with SDL2

### Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented audio pipeline with silence detection
- Tested multiple streaming approaches (0.5s chunks, 2s chunks, hybrid)
- Built whisper-stream binary for testing
- Discovered fundamental Whisper limitations for streaming

### Key Decisions
- **Removed streaming mode entirely** after extensive testing
- Whisper requires full context for accuracy (streaming quality peaked at 6/10)
- Partial text display was distracting and unprofessional
- Single mode with 2-3s wait provides consistent 10/10 quality
