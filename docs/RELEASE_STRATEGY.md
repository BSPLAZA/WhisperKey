# WhisperKey Release Strategy

## Critical Analysis & Improved Approach

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Challenge
WhisperKey requires whisper.cpp, which is a command-line tool. This creates friction for non-technical users. We need to solve this elegantly.

## Improved Release Strategy

### Phase 1: Smart Installer (Week 1)
Instead of requiring users to install whisper.cpp separately, we should:

1. **Bundle Everything**
   ```
   WhisperKey-1.0.0.dmg
   â”œâ”€â”€ WhisperKey.app
   â”œâ”€â”€ WhisperKey Installer.app
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Embedded whisper.cpp binary (pre-built)
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Metal libraries
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Auto-downloads models on first run
   â”œâ”€â”€ Quick Start Guide.pdf
   â””â”€â”€ Applications (alias)
   ```

2. **First-Run Experience**
   - WhisperKey detects missing whisper.cpp
   - Offers to install automatically
   - Shows progress during model download
   - Tests setup before completing

### Phase 2: Multiple Distribution Channels (Week 2-3)

1. **GitHub Releases** (Developers)
   - Source code
   - Pre-built DMG
   - Homebrew formula

2. **Direct Download Site** (General Users)
   - Simple landing page
   - One-click download
   - Video tutorial

3. **Homebrew Cask** (Power Users)
   ```bash
   brew install --cask whisperkey
   ```

### Phase 3: App Store Considerations (Month 2+)

**Pros:**
- Discoverability
- Automatic updates
- Trust factor

**Cons:**
- Sandbox restrictions (can't install whisper.cpp)
- Review delays
- 30% revenue share

**Solution:** Offer both:
- App Store version (simplified, uses Core ML)
- Direct version (full features, uses whisper.cpp)

## Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. Dependency Management

**Current Problem:** Models are hardcoded to `~/Developer/whisper.cpp/models/`

**Solution:**
```swift
// Add to preferences
@AppStorage("whisperPath") private var whisperPath = "~/.whisperkey/whisper"
@AppStorage("modelsPath") private var modelsPath = "~/.whisperkey/models"
```

### 2. Installation Helper App

**WhisperKey Installer.app** should:
- Check system compatibility
- Install whisper.cpp to `~/.whisperkey/`
- Download selected models
- Verify installation
- Handle errors gracefully

### 3. Error Recovery

Current code assumes whisper.cpp exists. We need:
- Graceful degradation
- Clear error messages
- Built-in troubleshooting

### 4. Security Considerations

- Code sign everything
- Notarize the DMG
- Use HTTPS for all downloads
- Verify model checksums

## User Journey Optimization

### For Non-Technical Users:
1. Download DMG
2. Drag WhisperKey to Applications
3. Launch â†’ Automatic setup wizard
4. Ready to use in 2 minutes

### For Developers:
1. `brew install --cask whisperkey`
2. Done

### For Privacy-Conscious Users:
1. Clone repo
2. Build from source
3. Inspect all code

## Marketing & Documentation

### README Structure:
1. **Hero Section**
   - Clear value prop
   - Demo GIF/video
   - Download button

2. **Features**
   - Privacy first
   - Works everywhere
   - No internet required

3. **Installation**
   - Simple path (DMG)
   - Developer path (Homebrew)
   - Build from source

4. **Roadmap** (Transparency)
   - Multi-language support
   - Custom vocabulary
   - Cloud sync (optional)
   - Windows/Linux ports

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **whisper.cpp breaks** â†’ Pin specific version
2. **Model downloads fail** â†’ Retry logic, mirrors
3. **Permissions issues** â†’ Clear guidance
4. **Performance problems** â†’ Model recommendations

### User Experience Risks:
1. **Setup too complex** â†’ Automated installer
2. **Unclear errors** â†’ Better messaging
3. **No feedback** â†’ Progress indicators
4. **Can't uninstall** â†’ Uninstaller app

## Success Metrics

Track anonymously (with consent):
- Installation success rate
- Model download completion
- Daily active users
- Feature usage

## Timeline

### Week 1:
- [ ] Build installer app
- [ ] Create DMG packaging script
- [ ] Write visual setup guide
- [ ] Test on clean systems

### Week 2:
- [ ] GitHub release
- [ ] Create landing page
- [ ] Submit to Homebrew

### Week 3:
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Fix critical issues
- [ ] Plan v1.1

## Open Questions

1. Should we embed whisper.cpp binary or download it?
2. How to handle Apple Silicon vs Intel?
3. Should we offer a "portable" version?
4. How to handle model updates?

## Conclusion

The proposed hybrid approach is good, but we can do better:
1. Eliminate whisper.cpp installation friction
2. Provide multiple distribution channels
3. Keep App Store as future option
4. Focus on user experience first

The key is making it as easy as any App Store app while maintaining the benefits of open source.
