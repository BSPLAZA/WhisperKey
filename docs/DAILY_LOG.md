## 2025-07-13 (Sunday) - Critical Fix and Sound Improvements

**Time**: 3:35 AM - 4:00 AM PST  
**Goal**: Fix critical text insertion regression and improve sound feedback

**Progress**:
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Critical Text Insertion Bug (Issue #022)**:
  - Root cause: Optional chaining in DictationService returned nil
  - `let insertionResult = try await self?.textInsertion.insertText()` returned Optional
  - Neither `.insertedAtCursor` nor `.keyboardSimulated` matched nil value
  - Code fell through silently without any action
  - Fixed with proper guard statement to handle optional
  - Changed TextInsertionService to always try keyboard simulation as fallback

- ‚úÖ **Improved Sound Feedback Logic**:
  - Differentiated between intentional and error clipboard saves
  - Glass sound: Successful text insertion in text fields
  - Pop sound: Only plays for error/fallback clipboard saves
  - No sound when "Always save to clipboard" is ON (intentional behavior)
  - Better user experience with context-appropriate audio feedback

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ Text insertion in text fields works correctly again
- ‚úÖ Moving to non-text field saves to clipboard appropriately  
- ‚úÖ No more error sounds when switching contexts
- ‚úÖ Sound feedback is context-appropriate
- üìù Note: App captured "bell dings" in transcription (minor audio settings issue for later)

**Key Learnings**:
- Always use guard with optional chaining results
- Many apps don't report focus via AX API - need fallbacks
- Swift optionals can cause silent failures if not handled properly
- User feedback on sounds is important for good UX

**Next Steps**:
- Polish Models tab UI to match other tabs ‚úÖ
- Continue comprehensive testing across different apps ‚úÖ
- Address remaining UI polish items from documentation

**Additional Progress** (12:57 PM PST):
- ‚úÖ **Polished Models Tab UI**:
  - Implemented SettingsSection components for consistency
  - Switched from Form to ScrollView layout
  - Added visual hierarchy matching Recording/General tabs
  - Updated icons from animals to abstract circles per user feedback
  - Much cleaner and more professional appearance

- ‚úÖ **Created Testing Documentation**:
  - Updated TESTING_GUIDE.md with current results
  - Created TESTING_SUMMARY.md with release readiness assessment
  - Documented working apps: TextEdit, Safari, VS Code, Xcode, Slack, Terminal
  - Identified apps needing testing: Chrome, Discord, Mail

**Release Status**: Feature complete, ready for final testing and DMG creation

**Additional Progress** (1:50 PM PST):
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Updates**:
  - Updated main README.md with current features and known issues
  - Updated developer docs/README.md with current status
  - Updated CURRENT_STATUS.md with July 13 fixes
  - Fixed incorrect hotkey references (F5 ‚Üí Right Option)

- ‚úÖ **Process Documentation**:
  - Documented Issue #024: Process violation (committed without testing)
  - Reinforced workflow: Build ‚Üí User Test ‚Üí User Approval ‚Üí Commit
  - Learning experience documented for future reference

**Next Steps**: Test remaining apps (Chrome, Discord, Mail), polish onboarding UI

**Additional Progress** (2:00-3:00 PM PST):
- ‚úÖ **Models Tab Icon Refinement**:
  - Removed icons per user feedback - clean text-only design
  - User said "not a huge fan of the icons" - kept it simple
  - Committed after user approval with "lgtm"

- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation Update**:

- ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate onboarding window references

**Discovered**:
- Window references must be retained strongly or they get GC'd
- Menu bar apps need careful window lifecycle management
- xcodebuild requires full Xcode.app, swift build works with CLI tools
- NSHostingController windows need isReleasedWhenClosed = false

**Blockers**:
- User needs to rebuild and test if windows now open correctly
- Hotkey activation still needs verification

**Time Spent**: 2 hours

**Tomorrow's Focus**:
- Verify window fixes work for user
- Debug hotkey if still not working
- Complete testing across applications
- Prepare for release

**Code Snippets/Commands**:
```swift
// Proper window management pattern
class WindowManager: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = WindowManager()
    private var window: NSWindow?
    
    func showWindow() {
        let window = NSWindow(...)
        window.isReleasedWhenClosed = false
        self.window = window // Keep strong reference
        window.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
        NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
    }
}
```

## 2025-07-09 (Wednesday) - Part 2: Major UX Improvements

**Goal**: Improve overall user experience based on user feedback

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Added recording duration timer (0:XX format) in indicator
- ‚úÖ Added warning when approaching max recording time ("Stopping in Xs")
- ‚úÖ Implemented audio feedback sounds (Tink on start, Pop on stop, Glass on success)
- ‚úÖ Researched common dictation app user requests
- ‚úÖ Added "ESC to cancel" hint in recording indicator
- ‚úÖ Improved success feedback - shows word count inserted
- ‚úÖ Added 3-second auto-clear for success messages
- ‚úÖ Increased indicator window size for better visibility

**Key UX Improvements**:
1. **Recording Timer** - Users now see exactly how long they've been recording
2. **Time Limit Warning** - Yellow warning appears 10 seconds before max time
3. **Audio Feedback** - System sounds for start/stop/success (if enabled)
4. **Better Success Feedback** - "‚úÖ Inserted X words" instead of generic message
5. **Visual Hints** - ESC key hint for canceling recording

**Research Findings**:
- Users want cross-app functionality (‚úì we have this)
- Offline support is critical (‚úì we have this)
- Custom vocabulary support (future feature)
- Voice commands for punctuation (future feature)

**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

**Next Steps**:

## 2025-07-09 (Wednesday) - UI Cleanup & The Great Right Option Debugging Saga

**Goal**: Clean up UI and fix Right Option key detection

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Removed "Test Right Option Key" diagnostic button
- ‚úÖ Added "About WhisperKey" menu item
- ‚úÖ Renamed "Preferences" to "Settings"
- ‚úÖ Fixed window sizing (600x500 for Settings, 600x600 for Onboarding)
- ‚úÖ Improved spacing in Settings dialog
- ‚úÖ Reduced hotkey options to just Right Option and F13
- ‚úÖ Implemented tap-to-toggle for hotkeys
- ‚úÖ Added model selection indicator in Models tab
- ‚úÖ SOLVED Right Option "bug" (it was set to F13 in preferences!)

**The Right Option Debugging Saga**:
- Spent 2+ hours debugging why Right Option wasn't working
- Added extensive logging, removed permission checks, restored old code
- Turns out the user had F13 selected in preferences, not Right Option!
- The logs clearly showed "selectedHotkey: f13" but we missed it

**Lesson Learned**:
```
ALWAYS CHECK USER CONFIGURATION FIRST!
The simplest explanation is usually correct.
```

**Key Changes**:
- Simplified menu bar UI
- Better window sizing and spacing
- Tap-to-toggle hotkey behavior (not press-and-hold)
- Force set to right_option for testing (needs removal)

**Time Spent**: 3 hours (mostly chasing a non-bug)

**Next Steps**:
- Remove the force setting of right_option
- Test across 8 applications
- Handle readonly fields gracefully
- Remember to check settings before debugging!

## 2025-07-01 (Day 1 - Session 2)

**Goal**: Fix F5 interception and accessibility permission issues

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Tested fixes - both issues persisted
- ‚úÖ Deep research into macOS dictation and key interception
- ‚úÖ Discovered F5 is system-reserved at kernel level
- ‚úÖ Pivoted to menu bar app architecture
- ‚úÖ Selected HotKey library for reliable global shortcuts
- ‚úÖ Created new MenuBarApp.swift implementation
- ‚úÖ Documented architectural decisions (ADR-005, ADR-006)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive fix scripts
- ‚úÖ Created transition guide for new architecture

**Discovered**:
- **F5 is untouchable**: macOS intercepts it before any user-space app
- **CGEventTap limitations**: Can't block system-reserved keys
- **TCC database issues**: Known macOS bug causes false negatives
- **Carbon Events still work**: Though deprecated, most reliable for hotkeys
- **Menu bar apps are ideal**: Standard pattern for this type of utility
- **F13-F19 are perfect**: Designed for custom functions, no conflicts

**Blockers**:
- F5 cannot be intercepted (system limitation) - RESOLVED by architecture change
- False TCC status requires app restart - documented in UI

**Time Spent**: 5 hours

**Tomorrow's Focus**:
- Build and test new menu bar architecture
- Implement recording with customizable hotkeys
- Test accessibility features work properly
- Document any new issues discovered

**Code Snippets/Commands**:
```bash
# Fix attempts (for documentation)
defaults write com.apple.HIToolbox AppleDictationAutoEnable -int 0
sudo killall tccd
tccutil reset Accessibility com.example.WhisperKey

# New architecture testing
swift package init --type executable
swift package update
```

## 2025-07-10 (Wednesday) - Language Support Research

**Goal**: Research multi-language dictation capabilities and plan future support

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Researched Apple's dictation (auto-detection broken since iOS 13!)
- ‚úÖ Investigated Whisper's capabilities (99 languages, auto-detection)
- ‚úÖ Studied code-switching challenges (mixed languages in same utterance)
- ‚úÖ Created ADR-019 for multi-language strategy
- ‚úÖ Created ADR-020 for model flexibility
- ‚úÖ Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md with prioritized language roadmap

**Discovered**:
- Apple claims auto language detection but users report it's completely broken
- Whisper has robust language detection with `--language auto` flag
- Code-switching (mixing languages) remains challenging for all systems
- Dragon Dictation charges $699 but has best accuracy
- Whisper supports 99 languages from 680,000 hours of training data

**Key Insights**:
- **Start simple**: Manual language selection first, auto-detection later
- **User control essential**: Always provide override for auto-detection
- **Model abstraction needed**: Don't tie too tightly to Whisper
- **Rebranding consideration**: "WhisperKey" name may be limiting

**Time Spent**: 0.5 hours

**Next Focus**:
- Continue with English-only for v1.0
- Test across 8 applications
- Consider implementing language dropdown in v1.1

**Update (08:35)**:
- Fixed critical UI issues:
  - Timer now resets properly between recordings
  - Recording dialog text no longer truncated (400x60px)
  - Removed ESC hint from indicator
  - Fixed onboarding layout with ScrollView
  - Fixed onboarding showing repeatedly bug
- Committed all changes successfully

**Update (09:00)**:
- Fixed more issues based on user feedback:
  - Timer now properly resets by recreating view each time
  - Simplified onboarding text to just "Tap Right Option key (activation key)"
  - Added auto-refresh timer for permissions (checks every 0.5s)
  - Added all Whisper models to onboarding (base/small/medium + multilingual + large-v3)
- Note: Model path currently hardcoded to ~/Developer/whisper.cpp/models/
  - Consider adding preference for custom model path in future
  - Could scan common locations or let user browse

**Update (09:30)**:
