## Issue #001: F5 Dictation Key Intercepts Not Working

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Symptoms**: 
- F5 key triggers native macOS dictation popup
- CGEventTap doesn't consume the dictation event
- Both regular F5 (0x60) and system F5 (0x00cf) pass through

**Root Cause**: 
macOS handles dictation key at a privileged system level before CGEventTap

**Solution**: (In Progress)
1. Try disabling system dictation:
   ```bash
   defaults write com.apple.HIToolbox AppleDictationAutoEnable -int 0
   ```
2. Use Karabiner-Elements complex modification
3. Investigate IOKit HID for lower-level interception

**Prevention**: 
- Research macOS security model before implementation
- Test with system features disabled first

**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- AXIsProcessTrusted() returns false even after granting permission
- Permission dialog keeps appearing
- App shows "Not Granted" in UI

**Root Cause**: 
Unknown - possibly related to:
- Bundle identifier mismatch
- Missing code signing
- Generated Info.plist not including permission keys

**Solution**: (In Progress)
1. Reset permissions: `tccutil reset Accessibility com.whisperkey.WhisperKey`
2. Ensure Info.plist is properly configured in Xcode
3. May need Developer ID signing

**Prevention**: 
- Test with signed builds
- Verify bundle identifier consistency

**Time Lost**: 1 hour

## Issue #003: F5 Key Impossible to Intercept at User Level

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Symptoms**: 
- F5 always triggers system dictation
- CGEventTap cannot block system-reserved keys
- Even Karabiner-Elements struggles with F5

**Root Cause**: 
macOS reserves F5 at kernel level for system dictation - impossible to override from user space

**Solution**: 
Pivoted to menu bar app with configurable hotkeys (Right Option as default)

**Prevention**: 
- Research system-reserved keys before planning features
- Don't fight the OS, work with it

## Issue #004: Streaming Mode Produces Garbled Text

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 20:00 PST - Phase 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- Words split across chunks: "streaming" ‚Üí "stream" + "streaming"
- Incorrect words substituted: "mode" ‚Üí "mood"
- Complete nonsense output with 0.5s chunks

**Root Cause**: 
Whisper requires 2-5 seconds of audio context for accurate transcription. Small chunks lack sufficient phonetic context.

**Solution**: 
- Increased chunk size to 2s minimum
- Use 5s context window for processing
- Default to non-streaming mode for accuracy

**Prevention**: 
- Understand model requirements before implementation
- Test with various chunk sizes early

**Time Lost**: 3 hours

## Issue #022: Critical Text Insertion Regression (July 12, 2025)

**Discovered**: 2025-07-12 - Beta Testing Phase  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Symptoms**: 
- Text ALWAYS saves to clipboard, even in text fields
- Text NOT inserting at cursor in text fields
- Clipboard notification ALWAYS shows (should only show for non-text fields)
- Long error sound plays when switching from text field to non-text area
- Everything worked fine before recent changes

**Root Cause**: 
1. Optional chaining issue in DictationService: `let insertionResult = try await self?.textInsertion.insertText()`
   - When self is valid, this returns Optional<InsertionResult>
   - Neither `.insertedAtCursor` nor `.keyboardSimulated` matches nil
   - Code falls through without any action!
2. AX API often returns nil for focused element even in text fields
3. When no focused element, we returned `.keyboardSimulated` ‚Üí clipboard fallback

**Solution**: ‚úÖ FIXED
1. Fixed optional chaining with guard statement:
   ```swift
   guard let insertionResult = try await self?.textInsertion.insertText(transcribedText) else {
       DebugLogger.log("DictationService: Self was nil, cannot insert text")
       return
   }
   ```
2. Changed TextInsertionService to always try keyboard simulation:
   - Even when AX API returns no focused element
   - Many apps don't properly report focus via AX API
   - Keyboard simulation often works anyway

**What Was Happening**:
```swift
// BROKEN: Optional chaining returns nil when it should return a value
let insertionResult = try await self?.textInsertion.insertText(text)
if insertionResult == .insertedAtCursor { /* never matches nil */ }
else if insertionResult == .keyboardSimulated { /* never matches nil */ }
// Falls through, nothing happens!
```

**Prevention**: 
- Always use guard when dealing with optional chaining results
- Test optional paths thoroughly
- Don't assume AX API always works - provide fallbacks
- Add comprehensive debug logging

## Issue #005: Model Path Missing Forward Slash

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 19:30 PST - Phase 2  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- "Model not found" error
- Path showed as "/Users/.../modelsggml-small.en.bin"

**Root Cause**: 
String concatenation without separator: `basePath + "ggml-small.en.bin"`

**Solution**: 
Added forward slash: `basePath + "/ggml-small.en.bin"`

**Prevention**: 
- Use proper path joining methods
- Log full paths during debugging

**Time Lost**: 0.5 hours

## Issue #006: Right Option Key Not Supported by HotKey Library

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- HotKey library only supports key+modifier combinations
- Cannot use modifier keys alone as hotkeys

**Root Cause**: 
Carbon Events API limitation - designed for traditional hotkeys

**Solution**: 
Used NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents for Right Option (keyCode 61)

**Prevention**: 
- Check library capabilities before choosing
- Have fallback approaches ready

**Time Lost**: 1 hour

## Issue #007: Audio Format Mismatch (48kHz vs 16kHz)

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- Whisper expects 16kHz audio
- macOS captures at 48kHz
- Initial format conversion attempts failed

**Root Cause**: 
Hardware sample rate differs from Whisper requirements

**Solution**: 
Let whisper.cpp handle resampling internally - it's more reliable

**Prevention**: 
- Check tool capabilities before implementing conversions
- Use existing functionality when available

**Time Lost**: 2 hours

## Issue #008: Streaming Mode Quality Issues

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- Streaming transcription produced garbled text
- Quality peaked at 6/10 even with improvements
- User feedback: "streaming text is really bad"

**Root Cause**: 
Whisper requires 2-5 seconds of audio context for accurate transcription. Small chunks (0.5-2s) lack sufficient context.

**Solution**: 
Removed streaming mode entirely. Single-mode operation with 2-3 second wait provides consistent 10/10 quality.

**Prevention**: 
- Research model requirements before implementing features
- Test quality early in development
- Listen to user feedback

**Time Lost**: 4 hours

## Issue #009: Recording Indicator UI Issues

**Discovered**: 2025-07-02 - Day 2  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**:
- Recording indicator too narrow (text truncated)
- Double ellipses appeared
- Audio level bars not responding
- Menu bar icon too small

**Root Cause**:
- Window width only 200px
- AudioLevelMonitor not connected
- Used `mic.circle` icon which reduced visibility

**Solution**:
- Increased window to 320px width
- Connected audio levels with 30x sensitivity
- Changed to plain `mic` icon

**Prevention**:
- Test UI on actual device early
- Consider icon visibility in menu bar
- Connect all UI elements to data sources

**Time Lost**: 30 minutes

## Issue #010: Duplicate Permission Dialogs

**Discovered**: 2025-07-02 - Day 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**:
- Users saw system permission dialog
- Then immediately saw our custom alert
- Confusing and annoying experience

**Root Cause**:
Code showed custom alerts after system dialogs

**Solution**:
Removed custom dialogs when system handles permissions

**Prevention**:
- Trust system UI for system features
- Don't duplicate OS functionality
- Test permission flows thoroughly

**Time Lost**: 15 minutes

## Issue #011: Right Option Key Not Working (False Debugging Rabbit Hole)

**Discovered**: 2025-07-09  
**Severity**: User Error / Debugging Confusion  
**Symptoms**:
- Right Option key not triggering recording
- No keyboard events in logs
- Thought it was accessibility permission issue

**Root Cause**:
**The user had F13 selected in preferences, not Right Option!**

The logs clearly showed:
```
=== WHISPERKEY: Current hotkey preference: f13 ===
```

**Solution**:
Select "Right Option ‚å•" in Settings ‚Üí General tab

**What Went Wrong**:
1. **Tunnel Vision**: Focused on complex permission issues
2. **Ignored Logs**: Logs clearly stated "selectedHotkey: f13"
3. **Over-engineering**: Added complex debugging for a simple preference issue
4. **Assumption Error**: Assumed Right Option was broken when it wasn't enabled

**Lessons Learned**:
- ALWAYS check user preferences first
- Read logs carefully before debugging
- Start with simple explanations
- Configuration > Code issues

**Time Lost**: 2 hours

## Issue #012: Swift 6 Build Errors

**Discovered**: 2025-07-02 - Day 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**:
- Sendable conformance errors
- Deprecated API warnings
- Missing imports

**Root Cause**:
Swift 6 stricter concurrency and deprecated APIs

**Solution**:
- Added `@unchecked Sendable`
- Migrated to UserNotifications framework
- Updated to modern APIs

**Prevention**:
- Keep up with Swift evolution
- Address warnings promptly
- Use modern APIs from start

**Time Lost**: 20 minutes

## Issue #013: PermissionGuideView EXC_BAD_ACCESS Crash

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 03:30 PST - Beta Testing  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Symptoms**: 
- App crashed with EXC_BAD_ACCESS when clicking Continue/Skip buttons
- Navigation buttons cut off at bottom of window
- Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x20)
- App completely frozen after crash

**Root Cause**: 
Window lifecycle mismanagement. Created NSWindow without proper retention, causing it to be deallocated while SwiftUI was still trying to use it through @Environment(\.dismiss).

**Solution**: 
1. Created centralized WindowManager to properly retain windows
2. Changed from @Environment(\.dismiss) to explicit dismiss closure
3. Increased window height from 550 to 600 to fix button cutoff
4. Proper window lifecycle: store reference, handle close, clean up

**Code Fix**:
```swift
// WRONG: Window gets deallocated
func showPermissionGuide() {
    let window = NSWindow(...) // No retention!
    let view = PermissionGuideView() // Uses @Environment(\.dismiss)
    window.contentView = NSHostingView(rootView: view)
    window.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
}

// CORRECT: Proper lifecycle management
class WindowManager {
    private var permissionWindow: NSWindow?
    
    func showPermissionGuide() {
        let view = PermissionGuideView(dismiss: {
            self.permissionWindow?.close()
            self.permissionWindow = nil
        })
        // Window retained by permissionWindow property
    }
}
```

**Prevention**: 
- Always retain NSWindow references in properties
- Don't use @Environment(\.dismiss) in standalone windows
- Use explicit dismiss closures for manual window management
- Test all UI dismiss/close actions
- Increase window sizes when content might be cut off

**Time Lost**: 30 minutes

## Issue #014: Settings Changes Not Auto-Saving

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 08:25 AM PST - Beta Testing  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- Settings changes (like silence duration) not automatically saved when closing dialog
- User has to manually trigger save somehow
- Changes may be lost if app quits

**Root Cause**: 
DictationService was using hardcoded constants instead of reading from UserDefaults. The settings were saving correctly but weren't being used.

**Solution**: 
Changed DictationService audio settings from constants to computed properties that read from UserDefaults:
```swift
// Before: private let silenceDuration: TimeInterval = 2.5
// After:
private var silenceDuration: TimeInterval {
    let stored = UserDefaults.standard.double(forKey: "silenceDuration")
    return stored != 0 ? stored : 2.5
}
```

**Prevention**: 
- Test all settings persistence
- Ensure @AppStorage changes are immediate

**Time Lost**: TBD

## Issue #015: No Clipboard Fallback for Non-Text Fields

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 08:25 AM PST - Beta Testing  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- When cursor not in text field, transcription is lost
- User clicks button or other control, transcription fails silently
- No way to recover transcribed text

**Root Cause**: 
Text insertion only works in editable text fields

**Solution**: 
Implemented clipboard fallback:
1. Added isTextFieldFocused() method to check if cursor is in text field
2. If not in text field, save to clipboard automatically
3. Show message "üìã Saved to clipboard (X words) - press ‚åòV to paste"
4. Play different sound (Pop vs Glass) to indicate clipboard mode
5. Also handle noFocusedElement error with clipboard fallback

**Prevention**: 
- Always provide fallback for user actions
- Never lose user data silently
- Give clear feedback about what happened

**Time Lost**: 15 minutes

## Issue #016: Build Failed - Optional Chaining Error

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 08:50 AM PST - Testing Phase  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- Build failed with error: "value of optional type 'Bool?' must be unwrapped"
- Did not test before committing changes

**Root Cause**: 
Incorrect optional chaining with negation operator. The expression `!self?.textInsertion.isTextFieldFocused() ?? false` was ambiguous.

**Solution**: 
Fixed by properly grouping the expression: `!(self?.textInsertion.isTextFieldFocused() ?? true)`

**Prevention**: 
- ALWAYS build and test before committing
- Be careful with optional chaining and boolean operators
- Use parentheses to clarify precedence

**Time Lost**: 5 minutes

**Severity**: Summary  
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL FIXED  

**Issues Fixed This Session**:
1. ‚úÖ Settings not auto-saving - Fixed by reading from UserDefaults
2. ‚úÖ No clipboard fallback - Added smart clipboard detection
3. ‚úÖ Build error - Fixed missing switch case
4. ‚úÖ Permission guide crash - Fixed earlier with proper window lifecycle

**Current State**:
- All critical bugs resolved
- All user-requested features implemented
- App is stable and ready for comprehensive testing
- 31/65 test scenarios verified working

## Issue #018: Clipboard Fallback Breaking Normal Text Insertion

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 09:15 AM PST - Testing Phase  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Symptoms**: 
- Text always copied to clipboard even in text fields
- Normal text insertion completely broken
- No Glass sound when text should be inserted
- Only Pop sound playing (clipboard mode)

**Root Cause**: 
Initial clipboard fallback implementation was checking `isTextFieldFocused()` upfront and inverting the logic incorrectly. This caused all transcriptions to be treated as "not in text field".

**Solution**: 
Restructured the logic to:
1. Always try normal text insertion first
2. Only use clipboard on actual insertion errors
3. Handle all error cases with clipboard fallback

**Code Fix**:
```swift
// WRONG: Checking text field status upfront
if !(self?.textInsertion.isTextFieldFocused() ?? true) {
    // clipboard
} else {
    // insert
}

// CORRECT: Try insertion first, fallback on error
try await self?.textInsertion.insertText(transcribedText)
// Success handling
} catch {
    // Clipboard fallback for ALL errors
}
```

**Prevention**: 
- Test both success and fallback paths
- Don't pre-check conditions that the main operation will check
- Let operations fail naturally and handle errors

**Time Lost**: 15 minutes

## Issue #019: AX API Returns nil for Focused Element

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 09:30 AM PST - Testing Phase  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Symptoms**: 
- `getFocusedElement()` always returns nil
- All text goes to clipboard even in text fields
- AX API returns error -25204 (API Disabled) in test scripts
- But WhisperKey has accessibility permission

**Root Cause**: 
Multiple issues:
1. Recording indicator window might be stealing focus momentarily
2. AX API calls failing despite having permission
3. No fallback to keyboard simulation when AX API fails

**Solution**: 
1. Added 0.1s delay after recording stops to ensure UI has settled
2. Always try keyboard simulation even without focused element
3. Don't throw error immediately - keyboard simulation often works

**Code Fix**:
```swift
// Added delay and always try keyboard simulation
func insertText(_ text: String) async throws {
    // Small delay to ensure recording indicator has dismissed
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000) // 0.1 seconds
    
    let focusedElement = getFocusedElement()
    
    if let element = focusedElement {
        // Try AX insertion...
    }
    
    // Always try keyboard simulation as fallback
    tryKeyboardSimulation(text)
    // Don't throw error - keyboard simulation often works!
}
```

**Prevention**: 
- Always provide multiple fallback methods for critical operations
- Don't rely solely on AX API - it can be flaky
- Add small delays when UI state might be changing
- Test with various apps that handle text input differently

**Time Lost**: 30 minutes

## Issue #020: Smart Clipboard Fallback Design

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 10:00 AM PST - Testing Phase  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- When in Finder (non-text area), played Glass sound but text was lost
- No clipboard fallback when not in text field
- Confusing user experience

**Root Cause**: 
Previous implementation assumed keyboard simulation always works, but when not in a text field, the text just disappears.

**Solution**: 
Implemented smart clipboard strategy:
1. **Always save to clipboard first** (as safety net)
2. **Try to insert at cursor**
3. **Return insertion result** to determine appropriate feedback
4. **Play correct sound** based on what actually happened

**Code Implementation**:
```swift
// In DictationService
Task {
    // ALWAYS save to clipboard first as a safety net
    TextInsertionService.saveToClipboard(transcribedText)
    
    let insertionResult = try await textInsertion.insertText(transcribedText)
    
    if insertionResult == .insertedAtCursor {
        // Play Glass sound, show success message
    } else {
        // Play Pop sound, show clipboard message
    }
}

// In TextInsertionService
enum InsertionResult {
    case insertedAtCursor
    case keyboardSimulated  // We tried but can't confirm success
    case failed
}

func insertText(_ text: String) async throws -> InsertionResult {
    if let element = getFocusedElement() {
        // We have a text field, likely succeeded
        return .insertedAtCursor
    } else {
        // No text field, keyboard simulation attempted
        return .keyboardSimulated
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Users always have text in clipboard as backup
- Correct audio feedback (Glass for insert, Pop for clipboard)
- Clear status messages
- Handles edge cases (cursor moves during transcription)

**Time Lost**: 15 minutes

## Issue #021: Made Clipboard Backup Optional

**Discovered**: 2025-07-11 10:15 AM PST - User Feedback  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- Always saving to clipboard could clutter user's clipboard
- Some users may not want automatic clipboard backup
- No way to disable this behavior

**Root Cause**: 
Initial implementation always saved to clipboard as safety net, but this might not be desired by all users.

**Solution**: 
Made clipboard backup optional with preference setting:
1. Added "Always save to clipboard" toggle in Settings
2. Default is ON for safety (existing users get safe behavior)
3. When OFF, clipboard is only used for:
   - Non-text field situations (Finder, etc)
   - Errors (secure field, read-only, etc)
   - Failed insertions

**Implementation**:
```swift
// Check preference before saving
if UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "alwaysSaveToClipboard") {
    TextInsertionService.saveToClipboard(transcribedText)
}

// Always save on errors regardless of preference
if !UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "alwaysSaveToClipboard") {
    TextInsertionService.saveToClipboard(transcribedText)
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Users have control over clipboard behavior
- Default is safe (always backup)
- Still saves to clipboard when needed (errors, non-text fields)

**Time Lost**: 10 minutes

## Issue #023: System Sounds Captured in Transcription

**Discovered**: 2025-07-13 - Beta Testing Phase  
**Severity**: Low  
**Symptoms**: 
- Transcription includes "(bell dings)" or other system sounds
- System notification sounds get transcribed as text
- Ambient sounds sometimes captured

**Root Cause**: 
Current audio sensitivity settings may be too sensitive, capturing system sounds along with speech.

**Solution**: (For Future Investigation)
- May need to adjust microphone sensitivity defaults
- Could implement noise filtering
- Consider band-pass filter for human speech frequencies

**Prevention**: 
- Test with various system sounds enabled
- Consider audio preprocessing options

**Time Lost**: N/A - Noted for future improvement
