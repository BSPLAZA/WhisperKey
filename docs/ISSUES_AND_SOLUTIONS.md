## Issue #001: F5 Dictation Key Intercepts Not Working

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Symptoms**: 
- F5 key triggers native macOS dictation popup
- CGEventTap doesn't consume the dictation event
- Both regular F5 (0x60) and system F5 (0x00cf) pass through

**Root Cause**: 
macOS handles dictation key at a privileged system level before CGEventTap

**Solution**: (In Progress)
1. Try disabling system dictation:
   ```bash
   defaults write com.apple.HIToolbox AppleDictationAutoEnable -int 0
   ```
2. Use Karabiner-Elements complex modification
3. Investigate IOKit HID for lower-level interception

**Prevention**: 
- Research macOS security model before implementation
- Test with system features disabled first

**Time Lost**: 2 hours

## Issue #002: Accessibility Permission False Negative

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- AXIsProcessTrusted() returns false even after granting permission
- Permission dialog keeps appearing
- App shows "Not Granted" in UI

**Root Cause**: 
Unknown - possibly related to:
- Bundle identifier mismatch
- Missing code signing
- Generated Info.plist not including permission keys

**Solution**: (In Progress)
1. Reset permissions: `tccutil reset Accessibility com.whisperkey.WhisperKey`
2. Ensure Info.plist is properly configured in Xcode
3. May need Developer ID signing

**Prevention**: 
- Test with signed builds
- Verify bundle identifier consistency

**Time Lost**: 1 hour

## Issue #003: F5 Key Impossible to Intercept at User Level

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Symptoms**: 
- F5 always triggers system dictation
- CGEventTap cannot block system-reserved keys
- Even Karabiner-Elements struggles with F5

**Root Cause**: 
macOS reserves F5 at kernel level for system dictation - impossible to override from user space

**Solution**: 
Pivoted to menu bar app with configurable hotkeys (Right Option as default)

**Prevention**: 
- Research system-reserved keys before planning features
- Don't fight the OS, work with it

**Time Lost**: 4 hours

## Issue #004: Streaming Mode Produces Garbled Text

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 20:00 PST - Phase 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- Words split across chunks: "streaming" ‚Üí "stream" + "streaming"
- Incorrect words substituted: "mode" ‚Üí "mood"
- Complete nonsense output with 0.5s chunks

**Root Cause**: 
Whisper requires 2-5 seconds of audio context for accurate transcription. Small chunks lack sufficient phonetic context.

**Solution**: 
- Increased chunk size to 2s minimum
- Use 5s context window for processing
- Default to non-streaming mode for accuracy

**Prevention**: 
- Understand model requirements before implementation
- Test with various chunk sizes early

**Time Lost**: 3 hours

## Issue #005: Model Path Missing Forward Slash

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 19:30 PST - Phase 2  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- "Model not found" error
- Path showed as "/Users/.../modelsggml-small.en.bin"

**Root Cause**: 
String concatenation without separator: `basePath + "ggml-small.en.bin"`

**Solution**: 
Added forward slash: `basePath + "/ggml-small.en.bin"`

**Prevention**: 
- Use proper path joining methods
- Log full paths during debugging

**Time Lost**: 0.5 hours

## Issue #006: Right Option Key Not Supported by HotKey Library

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- HotKey library only supports key+modifier combinations
- Cannot use modifier keys alone as hotkeys

**Root Cause**: 
Carbon Events API limitation - designed for traditional hotkeys

**Solution**: 
Used NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents for Right Option (keyCode 61)

**Prevention**: 
- Check library capabilities before choosing
- Have fallback approaches ready

**Time Lost**: 1 hour

## Issue #007: Audio Format Mismatch (48kHz vs 16kHz)

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**: 
- Whisper expects 16kHz audio
- macOS captures at 48kHz
- Initial format conversion attempts failed

**Root Cause**: 
Hardware sample rate differs from Whisper requirements

**Solution**: 
Let whisper.cpp handle resampling internally - it's more reliable

**Prevention**: 
- Check tool capabilities before implementing conversions
- Use existing functionality when available

**Time Lost**: 2 hours

## Issue #008: Streaming Mode Quality Issues

**Discovered**: 2025-07-01 - Phase 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**: 
- Streaming transcription produced garbled text
- Quality peaked at 6/10 even with improvements
- User feedback: "streaming text is really bad"

**Root Cause**: 
Whisper requires 2-5 seconds of audio context for accurate transcription. Small chunks (0.5-2s) lack sufficient context.

**Solution**: 
Removed streaming mode entirely. Single-mode operation with 2-3 second wait provides consistent 10/10 quality.

**Prevention**: 
- Research model requirements before implementing features
- Test quality early in development
- Listen to user feedback

**Time Lost**: 4 hours

## Issue #009: Recording Indicator UI Issues

**Discovered**: 2025-07-02 - Day 2  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Symptoms**:
- Recording indicator too narrow (text truncated)
- Double ellipses appeared
- Audio level bars not responding
- Menu bar icon too small

**Root Cause**:
- Window width only 200px
- AudioLevelMonitor not connected
- Used `mic.circle` icon which reduced visibility

**Solution**:
- Increased window to 320px width
- Connected audio levels with 30x sensitivity
- Changed to plain `mic` icon

**Prevention**:
- Test UI on actual device early
- Consider icon visibility in menu bar
- Connect all UI elements to data sources

**Time Lost**: 30 minutes

## Issue #010: Duplicate Permission Dialogs

**Discovered**: 2025-07-02 - Day 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**:
- Users saw system permission dialog
- Then immediately saw our custom alert
- Confusing and annoying experience

**Root Cause**:
Code showed custom alerts after system dialogs

**Solution**:
Removed custom dialogs when system handles permissions

**Prevention**:
- Trust system UI for system features
- Don't duplicate OS functionality
- Test permission flows thoroughly

**Time Lost**: 15 minutes

**Discovered**: 2025-07-02 - Day 2  
**Severity**: High  
**Symptoms**:
- Sendable conformance errors
- Deprecated API warnings
- Missing imports

**Root Cause**:
Swift 6 stricter concurrency and deprecated APIs

**Solution**:

- Migrated to UserNotifications framework
- Updated to modern APIs

**Prevention**:
- Keep up with Swift evolution
- Address warnings promptly
- Use modern APIs from start

**Time Lost**: 20 minutes
