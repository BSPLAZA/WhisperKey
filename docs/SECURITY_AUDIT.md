# WhisperKey Security & Code Quality Audit

*Performed: 2025-07-10*

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Found

### 1. Hardcoded Path Vulnerability
**File:** `ModelManager.swift`, `WhisperCppTranscriber.swift`
```swift
private let modelPath = NSString(string: "~/Developer/whisper.cpp/models").expandingTildeInPath
```
**Risk:** Assumes specific directory structure, will fail for many users
**Fix Required:** Add configurable paths before release

### 2. Command Injection Risk
**File:** `WhisperCppTranscriber.swift`
```swift
let arguments = ["-m", modelPath, "-f", audioPath, "--language", "en", "-t", "8", "-np"]
```
**Risk:** If paths contain special characters, could be exploited
**Fix:** Properly escape all shell arguments

### 3. Temp File Security
**File:** `DictationService.swift`
```swift
let tempDir = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory
let fileName = "whisperkey_\(UUID().uuidString).wav"
```
**Risk:** Predictable temp file location, no cleanup on crash
**Fix:** Use secure temp file creation, ensure cleanup

## ðŸŸ¡ High Priority Issues

### 1. Error Information Leakage
**Issue:** Error messages might reveal system paths
```swift
self.downloadError[filename] = "Failed to install model: \(error.localizedDescription)"
```
**Fix:** Sanitize error messages shown to users

### 2. No Rate Limiting
**Issue:** User can trigger unlimited recording sessions
**Risk:** Resource exhaustion
**Fix:** Add rate limiting for recording starts

### 3. Memory Management
**Issue:** Audio buffers might not be released on error
```swift
audioFile?.framePosition = 0
audioFile?.read(into: buffer)
```
**Fix:** Ensure proper cleanup in all error paths

### 4. Permission Handling Race Condition
**Issue:** Permission checks might have TOCTOU issue
```swift
if !AXIsProcessTrusted() {
    // User could revoke permission here
    self.showError(...)
}
```
**Fix:** Handle permission revocation during operation

## ðŸŸ¢ Good Security Practices Found

âœ… No network connections (truly offline)
âœ… Secure input field detection working
âœ… Proper audio permission checks
âœ… Memory pressure monitoring
âœ… Automatic timeout on recordings
âœ… No analytics or tracking

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Synchronization Issues
**File:** `DictationService.swift`
```swift
@MainActor
class DictationService: ObservableObject {
    private var audioEngine: AVAudioEngine?
    // audioEngine accessed from multiple queues
}
```
**Fix:** Add proper thread synchronization

### 2. Resource Leaks
**Issue:** AVAudioFile not always closed
```swift
defer {
    audioFile?.close()
    audioFile = nil
}
```
**Fix:** Move to init/deinit pattern

### 3. Force Unwrapping
**Found in:** Multiple files
```swift
let audioData = try! Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
```
**Fix:** Never use force unwrap in production

### 4. Inefficient Model Loading
**Issue:** Models loaded on every transcription
**Fix:** Cache loaded models

## Privacy Concerns

### 1. Audio File Retention
**Current:** Temp files deleted after transcription
**Recommendation:** Overwrite with random data before deletion

### 2. Clipboard Usage
**Current:** Falls back to clipboard for text insertion
**Risk:** Clipboard history apps could capture
**Fix:** Add warning when using clipboard method

### 3. Debug Logging
**Good:** Now behind feature flag
**Check:** Ensure no sensitive data in logs

## Recommendations Before Release

### Immediate Fixes Required:
1. **Make paths configurable** - Critical for distribution
2. **Escape shell arguments** - Security vulnerability
3. **Fix force unwraps** - Crash potential
4. **Add error recovery** - Better user experience

### Quick Wins:
1. Add `@unchecked Sendable` conformance where needed
2. Replace `print()` statements we might have missed
3. Add timeout to all network operations
4. Validate all user inputs

### Architecture Improvements:
1. Create `WhisperService` protocol for testing
2. Add dependency injection for better testing
3. Create error recovery middleware
4. Add health check system

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with malformed audio files
- [ ] Test with missing whisper.cpp
- [ ] Test with revoked permissions
- [ ] Test with full disk
- [ ] Test with low memory
- [ ] Test with special characters in paths
- [ ] Test with multiple simultaneous recordings
- [ ] Test with system sleep/wake

## Security Checklist

- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] All paths properly escaped
- [ ] All errors sanitized
- [ ] All resources properly released
- [ ] All permissions checked at use time
- [ ] All temp files securely created/deleted

## Final Assessment

**Current State:** Beta quality, not production ready
**Required Work:** 2-3 days to fix critical issues
**Recommendation:** Fix critical issues before public release

The app has good bones but needs hardening before wide distribution. The privacy-first approach is excellent, but implementation details need work.
