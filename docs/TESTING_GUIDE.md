## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 001: Basic Dictation Flow
**Objective**: Verify end-to-end functionality  
**Steps**:
1. Press F5 key
2. Speak "Hello world period"
3. Wait for auto-stop
4. Verify text inserted

**Expected**: "Hello world." inserted at cursor  
**Result**: ‚è≥ Not Tested  

### Scenario 002: Interruption Handling
**Objective**: Test dictation interruption  
**Steps**:
1. Start dictation
2. After 2 seconds, press F5 again
3. Verify immediate stop

**Expected**: Partial transcription inserted  
**Result**: ‚è≥ Not Tested  

### Scenario 003: Secure Field Detection
**Objective**: Verify secure field handling  
**Steps**:
1. Focus password field
2. Press F5
3. Check for warning

**Expected**: Warning shown, no recording  
**Result**: ‚è≥ Not Tested

## Streaming vs Non-Streaming Quality Test Results

**Test Date**: 2025-07-01 21:00 PST  
**Test Phrase**: "If streaming mode is off, you'll only see the complete transcription at the end. Make sure to enable it in the settings!"

### Streaming Mode ON (Poor Quality)
| Model | Output | Quality Score |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| base.en | "It's true.Dreamingmode isoff.you'llonlysee thePleaseWeinscription.at theend.AndMake suresure toenablein thesetting.Thanks.you" | 2/10 |
| small.en | "It'sstreamstreamingmode is off.your ownonly seethe comcomplete transition.Inscriptionat the end.Make suretoenable it insettings." | 3/10 |
| medium.en | "youIfStreetstreaming mode.mode is on.off.you'll almost" | 1/10 |

### Streaming Mode OFF (Excellent Quality)
| Model | Output | Quality Score |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| base.en | "If streaming mode is off, you'll only see the complete transcription at the end. Make sure to enable it in the settings." | 10/10 |
| small.en | "If streaming. modeis off, you'll only see the complete transcription at the end. Make sure to enable it in the settings." | 9/10 |
| medium.en | "If streaming mode. isoff, you'll only see the complete transcription at the end. Make sure to enable it in the settings." | 9/10 |

### Key Findings
1. **Streaming with 0.5s chunks is unusable** - Produces garbled, nonsensical output
2. **Non-streaming mode has near-perfect accuracy** - All models perform excellently
3. **Whisper needs 2-5s of context** - Fundamental architecture requirement
4. **Medium model not necessarily better** - Sometimes performs worse on short chunks

### Recommended Configuration
- **Default**: Non-streaming mode for accuracy
- **Streaming**: Only with 2s+ chunks and 5s context window
- **Model**: Small.en offers best balance of speed and accuracy
