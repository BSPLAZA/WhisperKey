# Changes Summary - 2025-07-10 09:00

## Fixed Issues Based on User Feedback

### 1. Recording Timer Reset ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Timer was continuing from previous recording instead of resetting
**Solution**: Modified `RecordingIndicatorManager.showRecordingIndicator()` to always create a fresh view instance
**Result**: Timer now starts at 0:00 for each recording session

### 2. Onboarding Instructions ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Instructions were confusing with redundant information
**Old Text**: 
- "Tap Right Option key to start/stop recording"
- "Or tap the activation key again to stop"  
- "Press ESC to cancel recording"
**New Text**: 
- "Tap Right Option key (activation key) to start/stop recording"
**Result**: Cleaner, simpler instruction that covers all cases

### 3. Permissions Auto-Update ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Permission status didn't update automatically after granting
**Solution**: Added Timer that checks permissions every 0.5 seconds while on permissions step
**Result**: UI updates immediately when permissions are granted

### 4. Model Selection ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Only showing English models, missing multilingual and large-v3
**Old Models**: base.en, small.en, medium.en
**New Models**: 
- base.en, base (multilingual)
- small.en, small (multilingual)
- medium.en, medium (multilingual)
- large-v3
**Result**: Users can now choose from all available Whisper models

### 5. Model Path Consideration üìù
**Current**: Hardcoded to `~/Developer/whisper.cpp/models/`
**Future Options**:
1. Add user preference for custom path
2. Auto-detect common locations
3. Import models to app directory
**Documentation**: Created MODEL_PATH_CONSIDERATIONS.md
